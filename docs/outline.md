Duotronic Computing — Revised Working Outline
1. Why Binary Won
Physical reliability, determinism, control, and ecosystem inertia as virtues—not accidents.
2. When Binary Struggles
Structural overhead arising from neutrality, uncertainty, symmetry, and majority semantics.
3. Ternary as Semantics (Not Substrate)
Three-valued logic as a meaning model, not a storage or control system.
4. Duotronic, Not Replacement
Why ternary must remain subordinate, optional, and bounded; coprocessors as precedent.
5. Failure Modes
Where ternary semantics add cost, hide errors, or degrade clarity.
6. Open Questions and Falsification Criteria
What would justify proceeding—and what would definitively end the exploration.
