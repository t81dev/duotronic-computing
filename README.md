# Duotronic Computing

This repository contains **interpretive and contextual material** exploring
*duotronic computing*: the cooperative use of binary and ternary systems.

It is **not a specification**.

Formal semantics, conformance rules, and reference implementations for the
Ternary Logic Unit (TLU) live in the companion repository:

→ https://github.com/t81dev/duotroic-whitepaper

## Scope

This repository focuses on:

- motivation and conceptual framing
- historical analogies (e.g., FPUs, SIMD, accelerators)
- potential application domains
- design intuition and trade-offs
- negative space: where ternary semantics do *not* help

No material here is normative or binding.

## Relationship to the TLU Specification

- This repository **depends on** the TLU specification.
- It does not redefine semantics, operations, or correctness criteria.
- Any disagreement between narrative material here and the specification
  must be resolved in favor of the specification.

## Status

This repository is exploratory by design.
Content may evolve, be revised, or be abandoned without version guarantees.
