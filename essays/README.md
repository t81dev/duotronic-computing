# Essays

These essays explore duotronic computing as an idea space.

They are:
- non-normative  
- intentionally conservative  
- exploratory rather than prescriptive  
- complete as a set  

No single essay should be read as a recommendation, roadmap, or proposal.  
Disagreement with any or all of these essays is expected and acceptable.

Some essays apply duotronic reasoning to existing conceptual models (e.g., layered system abstractions) **as a means of stress-testing semantic boundaries**, not as an argument for adoption or redesign.

This collection defines a boundary for reasoning, not a direction for development.  
No further essays are implied or required.
